\chapter{Server backend application}
\label{chap:server-backend}
%
The server backend is the part of the system that communicates directly with the X clients, 
and takes care to transfer the necessary requests to the frontend application, as well as 
transferring back the replies and events sent from the frontend.

Another important point about this application is that it caches the information received 
from the X client and back from the frontend application, and using this cache tries to
handle requests coming from the X client locally, without transferring them when not needed.

We will here discuss about how this application is designed and implemented.
