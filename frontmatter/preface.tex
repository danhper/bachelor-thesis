\chapter{Preface}
This report is written in partial fulfillment of the requirement 
for the degree of Bachelor in Computer Science. 

The project presented here is still under active development and 
will continue to be at least during the next six months. When writing 
this paper, the application is at a state where the main framework 
is operational and basic examples can be ran, but is still very far 
from being able to respond to a real world use case. The integrity 
of the project source code is available on
