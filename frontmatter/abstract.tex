  Most new users to Linux have a lot of problems to set up a 
  Linux installation, which is however often necessary for students 
  in computer science. Using a remote server with already all the 
  necessary tools prepared would therefore be a good alternative.
  However, SSH is the most common way to connect to a remote server,
  and there is no secure way to connect to a remote server 
  with a graphical user interface.
  However, having to do everything over SSH would probably be too  
  difficult for someone who is not yet used enough to programming 
  and UNIX/Linux. The purpose of this research is to develop 
  an X server running in any web browser and able 
  to connect to a remote UNIX/Linux server, so that one could access a remote server using 
  a GUI without any need to install anything on his or her computer.
