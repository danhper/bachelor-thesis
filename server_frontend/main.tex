\chapter{Server frontend application}
\label{chap:server-frontend}
%
The server frontend is the part of the application that ensures 
the communication between the backend and the web browser is done 
properly. It communicates through TCP sockets with the backend
and through web sockets with the web browser.

It also has the important role of login manager. On a client connection, 
it first checks the login and password of the user, and launches a new 
backend instance for the user is the connection is accepted.

In this chapter, we will give more detailed explanation of how this 
application works, the reason for which it is needed, 
the different pitfalls when implementing it, and some possible improvements.
