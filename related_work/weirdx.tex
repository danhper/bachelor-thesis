WeirdX\footnote{http://www.jcraft.com/weirdx/} is an X server implementation completely written in Java.
It is basically quite different from this project as it is an X server and not a 
server/client system. However, by using Java Applets, it is possible to access 
a remote computer from a web browser.

That said, as the X server is completely running in the web browser and the clients 
are directly connecting to it, there are a lot of things that cannot be achieved. 
For example, a single instance will only be able to run for a single user, 
and it seems complicated to log users in and out through this system.
