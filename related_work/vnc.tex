\section{RealVNC}
RealVNC\footnote{\url{http://www.realvnc.com/}} is a remote access software that also 
allows clients to take control of a remote computer from their web browsers. There are however some major differences with this project.

RealVNC uses the Virtual Networking Computing (VNC) protocol to handle 
communication between the server and the client.

A big advantage of this method is that an existing implementation of the X server 
can be used, as the rendering can be done on the server side and the pixmap is passed 
through from the server to the client.

However, an inconvenient of this approach is that it can use a lot of bandwidth and though 
some optimization can be done, it remains way higher than a single JSON object used in this
project.

Another difference with this project is that the user already needs to be logged in 
to access the remote computer and it can therefore not be used as a login manager, nor 
can be used efficiently for multiple users access.
