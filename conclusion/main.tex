\chapter{Conclusion}
% What is your conclusion?
\section{Discussion and future work}
The evaluation of the system has not been possible as the system implementation have not gone far enough yet.
There are a lot of points that need further confirmation, and a we will
especially need to check performance in a real use-case, to see 
if the system could actually be used responding to real-world requirements.
% You should add qualitative assessment even if you have not implemented your system yet.
% You can mention your experiments to build your system instead of evaluations.

Some unsolved problems still remain, such as truetype fonts handling, 
or large data transfer. Truetype fonts could be rendered as drawings using 
Canvas
\footnote{The \href{http://typeface.neocracy.org/}{Typeface} project seems to be able to render truetype fonts using Canvas.}
. Large data transfer could be done opening another websocket channel 
to avoid blocking the main communication channel especially when the 
connection is slow.

This project will continue to be developed, and we will try to reach 
a real-world usable implementation in the next six months.
\section{Final words}
Though a lot of work still needs to be done, we have managed to 
build a system to use a Linux/UNIX machine from a web browser 
using the X protocol. 

From this experience, we could actually showed that new web technologies 
offer a lot of new possibilities, and we will try to continuing to prove it 
while continuing the project.
