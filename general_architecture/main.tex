\chapter{General architecture}
%
In this project, everything is based on the X protocol, but given the 
requirements of the system, there are a lot of things that needed to be 
handled in alternative ways. The core X protocol has only remained 
in the backend of the system, while the other parts and especially the 
frontend used in the browser is relying on much more modern technologies.

We will here discuss about the general architecture of this project, 
including the differences with the basic X protocol as well as their 
reason to be.
