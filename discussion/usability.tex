\section{Usability}

As written in section~\ref{sec:motivations}, beginners often have a lot of trouble 
installing Linux. Actually, we think that this is not anymore a problem proper to Linux, 
but rather that the simple fact of installing an operating system on a machine is not 
as evident as it may appear for a non-experienced user.

With the system as it is, the user should be able to access the system without 
any need to install any new software, not even a virtualization software. The only 
software that the user may need to install could be a modern browser, which 
should be done much more easily that setting up a virtual environment. Furthermore, 
all the softwares needed by the user on the remote machine can be managed by 
an administrator and the user would therefore not have any need to take care of the 
server configuration by himself. This should make Linux environments much easier 
to access and use for backend users with no technical knowledge in computing.
