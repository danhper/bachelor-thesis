\begin{abstract}
  Most new users to Linux have a lot of problems to set up a 
  Linux installation, which is however often necessary for students 
  in computer science. Using a remote server with already all the 
  necessary tools prepared would therefore be a good alternative, 
  but having to do everything over SSH would probably be too 
  difficult for someone who is not yet used enough to programming 
  and UNIX/Linux. The purpose of this research is to develop an X 
  server running in any web brower and able to connect to a remote 
  UNIX/Linux server, so that one could access a remote server using 
  a GUI without any need to install anything on his or her computer.
